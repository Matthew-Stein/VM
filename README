Repository from my Ubuntu VM. Learning the ropes.
Will be used in PCFC -- Practical Computing for Biologists

Ch4: Command Line Operations

Trying to call 'My Folder' will make the terminal search for
a directory called 'My' putting 'My\ Folder' tells it to include
the space in the full name.
(Review from REGEXs in ATBS and this book.)

Better just to avoid spaces and/or use _ instead.
ls -a nad ls -l both show signficantly more information.
ls -l is especially useful since it displays PERMISSIONS

Chapter 5: Handling text in the shell
> cat, grep, piping, etc.
> Using curl to grab from URL's
  Potentially flawed due to updated web security.

Chapter 6: Scripting with the shell
> making a script
	any text editor, save as .sh
	add #! /bin/bash to first line for any bash script
	save in the home/matt/scripts folder
	then change permission: chmod u+x 'scriptname'.sh
	Now you can call on it anywhere.

> Find and replace in Atom > click regex button then ^ for start of lines,
$ for end of lines. Use find and replace to hearts content.
> Use $1 , $2, etc instead of \1 \2 for captured groups replacement.
> didnt do the section on grabbing reference info with curl in a script,
due to permission/ id stuff.

Chapter 7-13 : Python Programming
Due to just having finished ATBS. Will just skim and write the occasional note
here. If anything intersting pops up I will go through it.

Chapter 7 Notes:
Calling env to raise python instead of direct is Better
#! /usr/bin/env python

Objects - super variables. With nested information in dot notation
ex. MyBike = object
    MyBike.Colour
    MyBike.Tires
    MyBike.Tires.Pressure
    etc etc.
    Methods (functions) can also be within this nest heirarchy
    MyBike.Steer(-4) #Steer to the left 4 degrees.

Chapter 8 Notes:
Nano:
  Alt ^ = copy
  shift U = paste
When using % placeholders: control interpretation with:
  %s = string, %d = integer, %f = float
  a dot then number put nex to % will round/show number of digits
  ex. %.2f - round float to 2 digits
Integer padding %5d will align right with space if the number is larger
 - for aligning outputs of different lengths.

Chapter 9 Notes:
type python to work directly in python console
REGEX:  [\w\s]+ - any number of words separated by spaces
        [A-Z]{3} - and combo of 3 letters

Chapter 10 Notes: Reading and Writing Files
use regex in python by first importing re
'import re'
