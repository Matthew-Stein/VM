Repository from my Ubuntu VM. Learning the ropes.
Will be used in PCFC -- Practical Computing for Biologists

Ch4: Command Line Operations

Trying to call 'My Folder' will make the terminal search for
a directory called 'My' putting 'My\ Folder' tells it to include
the space in the full name.
(Review from REGEXs in ATBS and this book.)

Better just to avoid spaces and/or use _ instead.
ls -a nad ls -l both show signficantly more information.
ls -l is especially useful since it displays PERMISSIONS

Chapter 5: Handling text in the shell
> cat, grep, piping, etc.
> Using curl to grab from URL's
  Potentially flawed due to updated web security.

Chapter 6: Scripting with the shell
> making a script
	any text editor, save as .sh
	add #! /bin/bash to first line for any bash script
	save in the home/matt/scripts folder
	then change permission: chmod u+x 'scriptname'.sh
	Now you can call on it anywhere. 
	
> Find and replace in Atom > click regex button then ^ for start of lines, 
$ for end of lines. Use find and replace to hearts content.
> Use $1 , $2, etc instead of \1 \2 for captured groups replacement. 
> didnt do the section on grabbing reference info with curl in a script, 
due to permission/ id stuff. 

Chapter 7-13 : Python Programming 
Due to just having finished ATBS. Will just skim and write the occasional note
here. If anything intersting pops up I will go through it.
